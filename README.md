## Healthcare-Spending-Streamlit

# Introduction

In the previous semester, I took a course on the healthcare systems of the United States. To my surprise, I discovered that the American healthcare system is severely lacking when compared to healthcare systems in other countries. Despite spending the most money on healthcare per capita GDP, the US has the highest healthcare utilization rates among all nations worldwide. Additionally, the US healthcare system operates as a quasi market economy, in contrast to the free-market healthcare economies found in Europe. I created this app to inform my audience about the rising cost of healthcare services in the US.

## Data Preparation

To prepare my data, I obtained the dataset from https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-health-spending-by-state-payer-type-service-2003-2019. This dataset contains a spending per capita metric in USD for each state broken down by subgroups, including hospital fees, medicare, medicaid, out-of-pocket costs, home health, dental fees, pharmaceuticals, private health insurance, and skilled nursing.

Using Python code in Microsoft Visual Studio Code, I created both a line chart and a bar chart to illustrate the increasing costs of each subgroup over time. The hospital fees and private health insurance costs were among the highest of the subgroups. In addition, I created a map showcasing the rising costs of healthcare spending over time in each state.

Overall, the dataset provided valuable insights into the increasing costs of healthcare spending in the US, which were effectively visualized through the line chart, bar chart, and map.

# Future Work: 
I want to understand why Hawaii and Alaska have the highest healthcare spending per capita in the U.S. I would need to research how isolation in Alaska and Hawaii affect the cost of living and healthcare delivery.
