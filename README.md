## Healthcare-Spending-Streamlit

# Introduction

In the previous semester, I took a course on the healthcare systems of the United States. To my surprise, I discovered that the American healthcare system is severely lacking when compared to healthcare systems in other countries. Despite spending the most money on healthcare per capita GDP, the US has the highest healthcare utilization rates among all nations worldwide. Additionally, the US healthcare system operates as a quasi market economy, in contrast to the free-market healthcare economies found in Europe. I created this app to inform my audience about the rising cost of healthcare services in the US.

# Future Work: 
I want to understand why Hawaii and Alaska have the highest healthcare spending per capita in the U.S. I would need to research how isolation in Alaska and Hawaii affect the cost of living and healthcare delivery.
