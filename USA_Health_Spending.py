One of the main reasons is the high cost of medical care and prescription drugs, which is driven by a lack of price regulation and negotiation, as well as the complexity of the healthcare system. Additionally, hospital fees have been increasing over time for a number of reasons. Some of the main factors contributing to rising hospital costs include technological advancements, administrative costs, and insurance coverage."
